## Documentation

This repository is part of the TED Semantic Web Services, aka TED-SWS System. If you would like to contribute to this project, or you are a simple user, please refer to the following project documentation pages:

* [Project documentation ](https://docs.ted.europa.eu/rdf-conversion/index.html)
* [GitHub pages with the enterprise architecture (in development)](https://docs.ted.europa.eu/rdf-conversion/_attachments/ted-sws-architecture/index.html)

# Installation & Usage
Two sets of installation instruction are foreseen: one for the software engineers and one for the semantic engineers.
The software engineers need these instructions to deploy on a local or a single machine testing server.
The semantic engineers need a set of CLI tools that help develop, validate and publish mapping suites.

* [Demo & Testing installation instructions for software engineers](https://docs.ted.europa.eu/rdf-conversion/technical/demo_installation.html)
* [Installation & Usage instructions for the Mapping Suite CLI toolchain](https://docs.ted.europa.eu/rdf-conversion/technical/mapping_suite_cli_toolchain.html)
