== Future work

In the future, another Master Data Registry type system will be used to
deduplicate entities in the TED-SWS system, which will be implemented
according to the requirements for deduplication of entities from
notices.

The future Master Data Registry (MDR) system for entity deduplication
should have the following architecture:

[arabic]
. *Data Ingestion*: This component is responsible for extracting and
collecting data from various sources, such as databases, files, and
APIs. The data is then transformed, cleaned, and consolidated into a
single format before it is loaded into the MDR.

. *Data Quality*: This component is responsible for enforcing data quality
rules, such as format, completeness, and consistency, on the data before
it is entered into the MDR. This can include tasks such as data
validation, data standardization, and data cleansing.

. *Entity Dedup*: This component is responsible for identifying and
removing duplicate entities in the MDR. This can be done using a
combination of techniques such as string-based, machine learning-based,
or knowledge-based methods.

. *Data Governance*: This component is responsible for ensuring that the
data in the MDR is accurate, complete, and up-to-date. This can include
processes for data validation, data reconciliation, and data
maintenance.

. *Data Access and Integration*: This component provides access to the MDR
data through a user interface and API's, and integrates the MDR data
with other systems and applications.

. *Data Security*: This component is responsible for ensuring that the
data in the MDR is secure, and that only authorized users can access it.
This can include tasks such as authentication, access control, and
encryption.

. *Data Management*: This component is responsible for managing the data
in the MDR, including tasks such as data archiving, data backup, and
data recovery.

. *Monitoring and Analytics*: This component is responsible for monitoring
and analysing the performance of the MDR system, and for providing
insights into the data to help improve the system.

. *Services layer*: This component is responsible for providing services
such as, indexing, search and query functionalities over the data.


All these components should be integrated and work together to provide a
comprehensive and efficient MDR system for entity deduplication. The
system should be scalable and flexible enough to handle large amounts of
data and adapt to changing business requirements.
