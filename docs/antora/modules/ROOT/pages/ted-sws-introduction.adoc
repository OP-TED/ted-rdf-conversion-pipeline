== Introduction

Although TED notice data is already available to the general public
through the search API provided by the TED website, the current offering
has many limitations that impede access to and reuse of the data. One
such important impediment is for example the current format of the data.

Historical TED data come in various XML formats that evolved together
with the standard TED XML schema. The imminent introduction of eForms
will also introduce further diversity in the XML data formats available
through TED's search API. This makes it practically impossible for users
to consume and process data that span across several years, as
their information systems must be able to process several different
flavours of the available XML schemas as well as to keep up with the
schema's continuous evolution. Their search capabilities are therefore
confined to a very limited set of metadata.

The TED Semantic Web Service will remove these barriers by providing one
common format for accessing and reusing all TED data. Coupled with the
eProcurement Ontology, the TED data will also have semantics attached to
them allowing users to directly link them with other datasets.
Moreover, users will now be able to perform much more elaborate
queries directly on the data source (through the SPARQL endpoint). This
will reduce their need for data warehousing in order to perform complex
queries.

These developments, by lowering the barriers, will give rise to a vast
number of new use-cases that will enable stakeholders and end-users to
benefit from increased availability of analytics. The ability to perform
complex queries on public procurement data will be equally open to large
information systems as well as to simple desktop users with a copy of
Excel and an internet connection.

To summarize, the TED Semantic Web Service (TED SWS) is a pipeline
system that continuously converts the public procurement notices (in XML
format) available on the TED Website into RDF format, publishes them
into CELLAR and makes them available to the public through CELLARâ€™s
SPARQL endpoint.
