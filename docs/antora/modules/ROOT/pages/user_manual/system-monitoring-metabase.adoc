= System monitoring with Metabase

This section describes how to work with Metabase, exploring user
interface, accessing dashboards, creating questions, and adding new data
sources. This description uses examples with real data and data sources
that are used on TED-SWS project. For advanced documentation please see link:https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/[Metabase user manual (latest)].

== Main concepts in Metabase

=== What is a question?

In Metabase, a question is a query, its results, and its visualization.

If you’re trying to figure something out about your data in Metabase,
you’re probably either asking a question or viewing a question that
someone else on your team created. In everyday usage, a question is
pretty much synonymous with a query.

=== What is a dashboard?

A dashboard is a data visualization tool that holds important charts and
text, collected and arranged on a single screen. Dashboards provide a
high-level, centralized look at KPIs and other business metrics, and can
cover everything from overall business health to the success of a
specific project.

The term comes from the automotive dashboard, which like its business
intelligence counterpart provides status updates and warnings about
important functions.

=== What is a collection?

In Metabase, a collection is a set of items like questions, dashboards
and subcollections, that are stored together for some organizational
purpose. You can think of collections like folders within a file system.
The root collection in Metabase is called Our Analytics, and it holds
every other collection that you and others at your organization create.

You may keep a collection titled “Operations” that holds all of the
questions, dashboards, and models that your organization’s ops team
uses, so people in that department know where to find the items they
need to do their jobs. And if there are specific items within a
collection that your team uses most frequently, you can pin those to the
top of the collection page for easy reference. Pinned questions in a
collection will also render a preview of their visualization.

=== What is a card?

A card is a component of a dashboard that displays data or text.

Metabase dashboards are made up of cards, with each card displaying some
data (visualized as a table, chart, map, or number) or text (like
headings, descriptive information, or relevant links).

== Metabase user interface

After successful authorization, metabase redirects to main page that is
composed of the following elements:

image:user_manual/media/image22.png[image,width=633,height=294]

[arabic]
. Slidebar with collections
. Settings, searching and adding new questions
. Home page (Quick last accessed dashboards or questions)

=== UC1 Manually updating the data

As a user I want to manually update the data so I will see the
questions/dashboards on the latest data.

For *updating data*:

[arabic]
. Click Settings -> Admin settings -> Databases

image:user_manual/media/image99.png[image,width=448,height=373]

[arabic, start=2]
. Go to Databases in the top menu

[arabic, start=3]
. To *update* the existing data source, click on the name of the necessary
database and then click on both actions: “Sync database schema now” and
“Re-scan field values now”. This will be done automatically but if you
want to have the latest data (i.e the processing is still running) you
could follow the steps below. However this is not considered a good
practice.
