== System overview

This section provides a high level overview of the TED-SWS system and
its components. As presented in the image below the system is built by
multitude of services / components grouped together to help to reach the
end goal. The system can be divided into 2 main parts:

* Controlling and monitoring
* Core functionality (code base / TED SWS pipeline)

Each part of the system is formed by a group of components.

Controlling and monitoring, controlled by an operation manager, contains
a workflow / pipeline management service (Airflow) and data
visualization service (Metabase). Using this group of services any user
should be able to control execution of the existing pipelines and also
monitor the execution results.

The core functionality has many services developed to accommodate the
entire transformation process of a public procurement notice (in XML
format) available on the TED Website into RDF format and to publish it
into CELLAR. Here is a short description of some of the main services:

* fetching service - fetching the notice from TED website
* indexing service - getting the unique XPATHs in a notice XML
* metadata normalisation service - extract notice metadata from the XML
* transformation service - transform the XML to RDF
* entity resolution and deduplication service - resolve duplicated
entities in the RDF
* validation service - validation the RDF transformation
* packaging service - creating the METS package
* publishing service - sending the METS package to CELLAR

== Pipelines structure ( Airflow DAGs )

In this section will see a graphic representation that will show the
flow and dependencies of the available pipelines (DAGs) in Airflow. In
this representation will see the presence of two users AirflowUser and
AirflowScheduler, where the AirflowUser is the user that will enable and
trigger the DAGs and AirflowScheduler is the Airflow component that will
start the DAGs automatically following a schedule.

The automatic triggered DAGs controlled by the Airflow Scheduler are:

* fetch_notices_by_date
* daily_check_notices_availibility_in_cellar
* daily_materialized_views_update

The DAGs marked with _purple_ (load_mapping_suite_in_database), _yellow_
(reprocess_unnormalised_notices_from_backlog,reprocess_unpackaged_notices_from_backlog,
reprocess_unpublished_notices_from_backlog,reprocess_untransformed_notices_from_backlog,
reprocess_unvalidated_notices_from_backlog) and _green_
(fetch_notices_by_date, fetch_notices_by_date_range,
fetch_notices_by_query) will trigger automatically the
*notice_processing_pipeline* marked with _blue_, and this will take care
of the entire processing steps for a notice. These can be used by a user
by manually triggering these DAGs with or without configuration.

The DAGs marked with _green_ (fetch_notices_by_date,
fetch_notices_by_date_range, fetch_notices_by_query) are in charge of
fetching the notices from TED API. The ones marked with _yellow_ (
reprocess_unnormalised_notices_from_backlog,
reprocess_unpackaged_notices_from_backlog,
reprocess_unpublished_notices_from_backlog,
reprocess_untransformed_notices_from_backlog,
reprocess_unvalidated_notices_from_backlog) will handle the reprocessing
of notices from the backlog. The purple marked DAG
(load_mapping_suite_in_database) will handle the loading of mapping
suites in the database that will be used to transform the notices.

== Notice statuses

During the transformation process through the TED-SWS system, a notice
will start with a certain status and it will transition to other
statuses when a particular step of the pipeline
(notice_processing_pipeline) offered by the system has completed
successfully or unsuccessfully. This transition is done automatically
and it will change the _status_ property of a notice. The system has the
following statuses:

* RAW
* INDEXED
* NORMALISED_METADATA
* INELIGIBLE_FOR_TRANSFORMATION
* ELIGIBLE_FOR_TRANSFORMATION
* PREPROCESSED_FOR_TRANSFORMATION
* TRANSFORMED
* DISTILLED
* VALIDATED
* INELIGIBLE_FOR_PACKAGING
* ELIGIBLE_FOR_PACKAGING
* PACKAGED
* INELIGIBLE_FOR_PUBLISHING
* ELIGIBLE_FOR_PUBLISHING
* PUBLISHED
* PUBLICLY_UNAVAILABLE
* PUBLICLY_AVAILABLE

The transition from one status to another is decided by the system and
can be viewed in the graphic representation below.

== Notice structure

This section aims at presenting the anatomy of a Notice in the TED-SWS
system and the dependence of structural elements on the phase of the
transformation process. This is useful for the user to understand what
happens behind the scene and what information is available in the
database, to build analytics dashboards.

The structure of a notice within the TED-SWS system consists of the
following structural elements:

* Status
* Metadata
** Original Metadata
** Normalised Metadata
* Manifestation
** XMLManifestation
** RDFManifestation
** METSManifestation
* Validation Report
** XPATH Coverage Validation
** SHACL Validation
** SPARQL Validation

The diagram below shows the high level structure of the Notice object
and that certain structural parts of a notice within the system are
dependent on its state. This means that as the transformation process
runs through its steps the Notice state changes and new structural parts
are added. For example, for a notice in the NORMALISED status we can
access the Original Metadata, Normalised Metadata and XMLManifestation
fields, for a notice in the TRANSFORMED status we can access in addition
the RDFManifestation field and similarly for the rest of the statuses.

The diagram depicts states as swim-lanes while the structural elements
are depicted as ArchiMate Business Objects [cite ArchiMate]. The
relations we use are composition (arrow with diamond ending) and
inheritance (arrow with full triangle ending).

As was mentioned above about the states through which a notice can
transition, a certain structural field if it is present at a certain
state, then all the states originating from this state will also have
this field. Not all possible states are depicted. For brevity, we chose
only the most significant ones, which segment the transformation process
into stages.
