<div class="paragraph">
<p>ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) architecture is considered
state-of-the-art for batch processing tasks using Airflow as pipeline
management for several reasons:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Flexibility</strong>: ETL architecture allows for flexibility in the data
pipeline as it separates the data extraction, transformation, and
loading processes. This allows for easy modification and maintenance of
each individual step without affecting the entire pipeline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong>: ETL architecture allows for the easy scaling of data
processing tasks, as new data sources can be added or removed without
impacting the entire pipeline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Error Handling</strong>: ETL architecture allows for easy error handling as
each step of the pipeline can be monitored and errors can be isolated to
a specific step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reusability:</strong> ETL architecture allows for the reuse of existing data
pipelines, as new data sources can be added without modifying existing
pipelines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>System management</strong>: Airflow is an open-source workflow management
system that allows for easy scheduling, monitoring, and management of
data pipelines. It integrates seamlessly with ETL architecture and
allows for easy management of complex data pipelines.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Overall, ETL architecture combined with Airflow as pipeline management
provides a robust and efficient solution for batch processing tasks.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_why_monolithic_architecture_vs_micro_services_architecture"><a class="anchor" href="#_why_monolithic_architecture_vs_micro_services_architecture"></a>Why Monolithic Architecture vs Micro Services Architecture?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are several reasons why a monolithic architecture may be more
suitable for an ETL architecture with batch processing pipeline using
Airflow as the pipeline management tool:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Simplicity</strong>: A monolithic architecture is simpler to design and
implement as it involves a single codebase and a single deployment
process. This makes it easier to manage and maintain the ETL pipeline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance</strong>: A monolithic architecture may be more performant than a
microservices architecture as it allows for more efficient communication
between the different components of the pipeline. This is particularly
important for batch processing pipelines, where speed and efficiency are
crucial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong>: Monolithic architectures can be scaled horizontally by
adding more resources to the system, such as more servers or more
processing power. This allows for the system to handle larger amounts of
data and handle more complex processing tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Airflow Integration</strong>: Airflow is designed to work with monolithic
architectures, and it can be more difficult to integrate with a
microservices architecture. Airflow&#8217;s DAGs and tasks are designed to
work with a single codebase, and it may be more challenging to manage
different services and pipelines across multiple microservices.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Overall, a monolithic architecture may be more suitable for an ETL
architecture with batch processing pipeline using Airflow as the
pipeline management tool due to its simplicity, performance,
scalability, and ease of integration with Airflow.</p>

<h3 id="_why_etlelt_approach_vs_event_sourcing"><a class="anchor" href="#_why_etlelt_approach_vs_event_sourcing"></a>Why ETL/ELT approach vs Event Sourcing ?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) architecture is typically used for moving
and transforming data from one system to another, for example, from a
transactional database to a data warehouse for reporting and analysis.
It is a batch-oriented process that is typically scheduled to run at
specific intervals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Event sourcing architecture, on the other hand, is a way of storing and
managing the state of an application by keeping track of all the changes
to the state as a sequence of events. This allows for better auditing
and traceability of the state of the application over time, as well as
the ability to replay past events to reconstruct the current state.
Event sourcing is often used in systems that require high performance,
scalability, and fault tolerance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In summary, ETL architecture is mainly used for data integration and
data warehousing, Event sourcing is mainly used for building highly
scalable and fault-tolerant systems that need to store and manage the
state of an application over time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A hybrid architecture is implemented in the TED-SWS pipeline, based on
an ETL architecture but with state storage to repeat a pipeline sequence
as needed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_why_batch_processing_vs_event_streams"><a class="anchor" href="#_why_batch_processing_vs_event_streams"></a>Why Batch processing vs Event Streams?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Batch processing architecture and Event Streams architecture are two
different approaches to processing data in code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Batch processing architecture is a traditional approach where data is
processed in batches. This means that data is collected over a period of
time and then processed all at once in a single operation. This approach
is typically used for tasks such as data analysis, data mining, and
reporting. It is best suited for tasks that can be done in a single pass
and do not require real-time processing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Event Streams architecture, on the other hand, is a more modern approach
where data is processed in real-time as it is generated. This means that
data is processed as soon as it is received, rather than waiting for a
batch to be collected. This approach is typically used for tasks such as
real-time monitoring, data analytics, and fraud detection. It is best
suited for tasks that require real-time processing and cannot be done in
a single pass.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In summary, Batch processing architecture is best suited for tasks that
can be done in a single pass and do not require real-time processing,
whereas Event Streams architecture is best suited for tasks that require
real-time processing and cannot be done in a single pass.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Due to the fact that the TED-SWS pipeline has an ETL architecture, the
data processing is done in batches, the batches of notices are formed
per day, all the notices of a day form a batch that will be processed.
Another method of creating a batch is grouping notices by status and
executing the pipeline depending on their status.</p>

<h3 id="_why_nosql_data_model_vs_sql_data_model"><a class="anchor" href="#_why_nosql_data_model_vs_sql_data_model"></a>Why NoSQL data model vs SQL data model?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are several reasons why a NoSQL data model may be more suitable
for an ETL architecture with batch processing pipeline compared to a SQL
data model:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong>: NoSQL databases are designed to handle large amounts of
data and can scale horizontally, allowing for the easy addition of more
resources as the amount of data grows. This is particularly useful for
batch processing pipelines that need to handle large amounts of data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexibility</strong>: NoSQL databases are schema-less, which means that the
data structure can change without having to modify the database schema.
This allows for more flexibility when processing data, as new data types
or fields can be easily added without having to make changes to the
database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance</strong>: NoSQL databases are designed for high-performance and can
handle high levels of read and write operations. This is particularly
useful for batch processing pipelines that need to process large amounts
of data in a short period of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Handling Unstructured Data</strong>: NoSQL databases are well suited for
handling unstructured data, such as JSON or XML, that can&#8217;t be handled
by SQL databases. This is particularly useful for ETL pipelines that
need to process unstructured data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Handling Distributed Data</strong>: NoSQL databases are designed to handle
distributed data, which allows for data to be stored and processed on
multiple servers. This can help to improve performance and scalability,
as well as provide fault tolerance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: NoSQL databases are generally less expensive than SQL databases,
as they don&#8217;t require expensive hardware or specialized software. This
can make them a more cost-effective option for ETL pipelines that need
to handle large amounts of data.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Overall, a NoSQL data model may be more suitable for an ETL architecture
with batch processing pipeline compared to a SQL data model due to its
scalability, flexibility, performance, handling unstructured data,
handling distributed data and the cost-effectiveness. It is important to
note that the choice to use a NoSQL data model satisfies the specific
requirements of the TED-SWS processing pipeline and the nature of the
data to be processed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_why_airflow"><a class="anchor" href="#_why_airflow"></a>Why Airflow?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Airflow is a great solution for ETL pipeline and batch processing
architecture because it provides several features that are well-suited
to these types of tasks. First, Airflow provides a powerful scheduler
that allows you to define and schedule ETL jobs to run at specific
intervals. This means that you can set up your pipeline to run on a
regular schedule, such as every day or every hour, without having to
manually trigger the jobs. Second, Airflow provides a web-based user
interface that makes it easy to monitor and manage your pipeline.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both aspects of Airflow are perfectly compatible with the needs of the
TED-SWS architecture and the use cases required for an Operations
Manager that will interact with the system. Airflow therefore covers the
needs of batch processing management and ETL pipeline management.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Airflow provide good coverage of use cases for an Operations Manager,
specialized for this use cases:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Monitoring pipeline performance</strong>: An operations manager can use Airflow
to monitor the performance of the ETL pipeline and identify any
bottlenecks or issues that may be impacting the pipeline&#8217;s performance.
They can then take steps to optimize the pipeline to improve its
performance and ensure that data is being processed in a timely and
efficient manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Managing pipeline schedule</strong>: The operations manager can use Airflow to
schedule the pipeline to run at specific times, such as during off-peak
hours or when resources are available. This can help to minimize the
impact of the pipeline on other systems and ensure that data is
processed in a timely manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Managing pipeline resources</strong>: The operations manager can use Airflow to
manage the resources used by the pipeline, such as CPU, memory, and
storage. They can also use Airflow to scale the pipeline up or down as
needed to meet changing resource requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Managing pipeline failures</strong>: Airflow allows the operations manager to
set up notifications and alerts for when a pipeline fails or a task
fails. This allows them to quickly identify and address any issues that
may be impacting the pipeline&#8217;s performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Managing pipeline dependencies</strong>: The operations manager can use Airflow
to manage the dependencies between different tasks in the pipeline, such
as ensuring that notice fetching is completed before notice indexing or
notice metadata normalization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Managing pipeline versioning</strong>: Airflow allows the operations manager to
maintain different versions of the pipeline, which can be useful for
testing new changes before rolling them out to production.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Managing pipeline security</strong>: Airflow allows the operations manager to
set up security controls to protect the pipeline and the data it
processes. They can also use Airflow to audit and monitor access to the
pipeline and the data it processes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_why_metabase"><a class="anchor" href="#_why_metabase"></a>Why Metabase?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Metabase is an excellent solution for data analysis and KPI monitoring
for a batch processing system, as it offers several key features that
make it well suited for this type of use case required within the
TED-SWS system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, Metabase is highly customizable, allowing users to create and
modify dashboards, reports, and visualizations to suit their specific
needs. This makes it easy to track and monitor the key performance
indicators (KPIs) that are most important for the batch processing
system, such as the number of jobs processed, the average processing
time, and the success rate of job runs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Second, Metabase offers a wide range of data connectors, allowing users
to easily connect to and query data sources such as SQL databases, NoSQL
databases, CSV files, and APIs. This makes it easy to access and analyze
the data that is relevant to the batch processing system. In TED-SWS the
data domain model is realized by a document-based data model, not a
tabular relational data model, so Metabase is a good tool for analyzing
data with a document-based model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Third, Metabase has a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to
navigate and interact with data, even for users with little or no
technical experience. This makes it accessible to a wide range of users,
including business analysts, data scientists, and other stakeholders who
need to monitor and analyse the performance of the batch processing
system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, Metabase offers robust security and collaboration features,
making it easy to share and collaborate on data and insights with team
members and stakeholders. This makes it an ideal solution for
organizations that need to monitor and analyse the performance of a
batch processing system across multiple teams or departments.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_why_quick_deduplication_process"><a class="anchor" href="#_why_quick_deduplication_process"></a>Why quick deduplication process?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the main challenges in entities deduplication from the semantic
web domain is dealing with the complexity and diversity of the data.
This can include dealing with different data formats, schemas, and
vocabularies, as well as handling missing or incomplete data.
Additionally, entities may have multiple identities or representations,
making it difficult to determine which entities are duplicates and which
are distinct. Another difficulty is the scalability of the algorithm to
handle large amount of data. The performance of the algorithm should be
efficient and accurate to handle huge number of entities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are several approaches and solutions for entities deduplication in
the semantic web. Some of the top solutions include:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>String-based methods</strong>: These methods use string comparison techniques
such as Jaccard similarity, Levenshtein distance, and cosine similarity
to identify duplicates based on the similarity of their string
representations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Machine learning-based methods</strong>: These methods use machine learning
algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, and neural networks
to learn patterns in the data and identify duplicates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Knowledge-based methods</strong>: These methods use external knowledge sources
such as ontologies, taxonomies, and linked data to disambiguate entities
and identify duplicates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hybrid methods</strong>: These methods combine multiple techniques, such as
string-based and machine learning-based methods, to improve the accuracy
of deduplication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Blocking Method</strong>: This method is used to reduce the number of entities
that need to be compared by grouping similar entities together.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the TED-SWS pipeline, the deduplication of Organization type entities
is performed using a string-based methods. String-based methods are
often used for organization entity deduplication, because of their
simplicity and effectiveness.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TED Europe data often contains information about tenders and public
procurement, where organizations are identified by their names.
Organization names are often unique and can be used to identify
duplicates with high accuracy. String-based methods can be used to
compare the similarity of different organization names, which can be
effective in identifying duplicates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, the TED europe data is highly structured, so it&#8217;s easy to
extract and compare the names of organizations. String-based methods are
also relatively fast and easy to implement, making them a good choice
for large data sets. This methods may not be as effective for other
types of entities, such as individuals, where additional information may
be needed to identify duplicates. It&#8217;s also important to note that
string-based methods may not work as well for misspelled or abbreviated
names.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using a quick and dirty deduplication approach instead of a complex
system at the first iteration of a system implementation can be
beneficial for several reasons:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Speed</strong>: A quick approach can be implemented quickly and can
help to identify and remove duplicates quickly. This can be particularly
useful when working with large and complex data sets, where a more
complex approach may take a long time to implement and test.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: A quick and dirty approach is generally less expensive to
implement than a complex system, as it requires fewer resources and less
development time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simplicity</strong>: A quick and dirty approach is simpler and easier to
implement than a complex system, which can reduce the risk of errors and
bugs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexibility</strong>: A quick and dirty approach allows to start with a basic
system and adapt it as needed, which can be more flexible than a complex
system that is difficult to change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Testing</strong>: A quick and dirty approach allows to test the system quickly,
and get feedback from the users and stakeholders, and then use that
feedback to improve the system.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, it&#8217;s worth noting that the quick and dirty approach is not a
long-term solution and should be used only as a first step in the
implementation of a MDR system. This approach can help to quickly
identify and remove duplicates and establish a basic system, but it may
not be able to handle all the complexity and diversity of the data, so
it&#8217;s important to plan for and implement more advanced techniques as the
system matures.</p>
