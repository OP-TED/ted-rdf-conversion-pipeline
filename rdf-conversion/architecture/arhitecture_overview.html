<p>The main points of architecture for a system that will transform TED
notices from XML format to RDF format using an ETL architecture with
batch processing pipeline are:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Data collection</strong>: An API would be used to collect the
daily notices from the TED website in XML format and store them in a
data warehouse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Metadata management</strong>: A metadata management module would be collect, store and provide filtering capabilities for notices based on their features, such as form number, date of publication, XSD schema version, subform type, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data transformation</strong>: A data transformation module would be used to
convert the XML data into RDF format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data loading</strong>: The transformed RDF data would be loaded into a triple
store, such as Cellar, for further analysis or reporting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pipeline management</strong>: Airflow would be used to schedule and manage the
pipeline, ensuring that the pipeline is run on a daily basis to process
the latest batch of notices from the TED website. Airflow would also be
used to monitor the pipeline and provide real-time status updates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data access</strong>: A SPARQL endpoint or an API would be used to access the
RDF data stored in the triple store. This would allow external systems
to query the data and retrieve the information they need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security</strong>: The system would be protected by a firewall and would use
secure protocols (e.g. HTTPS) for data transfer. Access to the data
would be controlled by authentication and authorization mechanisms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong>: The architecture should be designed to handle large
amounts of data and easily scale horizontally by adding more resources
as the amount of data grows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexibility</strong>: The architecture should be flexible to handle changes in
the data structure without having to modify the database schema.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance</strong>: The architecture should be designed for high-performance
to handle high levels of read and write operations to process data in a
short period of time.</p>

<p>Figure 1.1 shows the compact, general image of the TED-SWS system
architecture from the system&#8217;s business point of view. The system
represents a pipeline for processing notices from the TED Website and
publishing them to the CELLAR service.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the monitoring and management of internal processes, the system
offers two interfaces. An interface for data monitoring, in the diagram,
the given interface is represented by the name of “Data Monitoring
Interface”. Another interface is for the monitoring and management of
system processes; in the diagram, the given interface is represented by
the name “Workflow Management Interface”. Operations Manager will use
these two interfaces for system monitoring and management.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The element of the system that will process the notices is the TED-SWS
pipeline. The input data for this pipeline will be the notices in XML
format from the TED website. The result of this pipeline is a METS
package for each processed notice and its publication in CELLAR, from
where the end user will be able to access notices in RDF format.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Providing, in Figure 1.1, a compact view of the TED-SWS system
architecture at the business level is useful because it allows
stakeholders and decision-makers to quickly and easily understand how
the system works and how it supports the business goals and objectives.
A compact view of the architecture can help to communicate the key
components of the system and how they interact with each other, making
it easier to understand the system&#8217;s capabilities and limitations.
Additionally, a compact view of the architecture can help to identify
any areas where the system could be improved or where additional
capabilities are needed to support the business. By providing a clear
and concise overview of the system architecture, stakeholders can make
more informed decisions about how to use the system, how to improve it,
and how to align it with the business objectives.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Figure 1.1 also is provided, input and output dependencies for a
TED-SWS system architecture. This is useful because it helps to identify
the data sources and data destinations that the system relies on, as
well as the data that the system produces. This information can be used
to understand the data flows within the system, how the system is
connected to other systems, and how the system supports the business.
Input dependencies help to identify the data sources that the system
relies on, such as external systems, databases, or other data sources.
This information can be used to understand how the system is connected
to other systems and how it receives data. Output dependencies help to
identify the data destinations that the system produces, such as
external systems, databases, or other data destinations. This
information can be used to understand how the system is connected to
other systems and how it sends data. By providing input and output
dependencies for the TED-SWS system architecture, stakeholders can make
more informed decisions about how to use the system, how to improve it,
and how to align it with the business objectives.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>XML Indexing Service</strong> is a service that extracts all unique XPaths from
an XML and stores them as metadata. Unique XPaths are used later to
validate if the transformation to RDF format, has been done for all

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Metadata Normalization Service</strong> is a service that normalises the

<p>The pipeline for processing a notice is the key element in the TED-SWS
system, the architecture of this pipeline from the business point of
view is represented in Figure 2. Unlike the previously presented
figures, in Figure 2 the pipeline is rendered in greater detail and are
presented relationships between pipeline steps and the artefacts that
produce or use them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Based on Figure 2, it can be noted that the pipeline is not a linear
one, within the pipeline there are control steps that check whether the
following steps should be executed for a notice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are 3 control steps in the pipeline, namely:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Check notice eligibility for transformation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check notice eligibility for packaging</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check notice availability in Cellar</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The “Check notice eligibility for transformation” step represents the
control of a notice if it can be transformed with a Mapping Suite, if it
can be transformed it goes to the next transformation step, otherwise
the notice is stored for future processing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The “Check notice eligibility for packaging” step checks if a notice RDF
manifestation after the validation step is valid for packaging in a METS
package. If it is valid, proceed to the packing step, otherwise, store
the intermediate result for further analysis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The “Check notice availability in Cellar” step checks, after the
publication step in Cellar, if a published notice is already accessible
in Cellar. If the notice is accessible, then the pipeline is finished,
otherwise the published notice is stored for further analysis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pipeline steps produce and use artefacts such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>TED-XML notice &amp; metadata;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mapping rules</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TED-RDF notice</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Figure 2 Single notice processing pipeline at business level</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Based on Figure 2, we can notice that the artefacts for a notice appear
with the passage of certain steps in the pipeline. To be able to
conveniently manage the state of a notice and all its artefacts
depending on its state, a notice represents an aggregate of artefacts
and a state, which changes dynamically during the pipeline.</p>

<h3 id="_notice_status_transition_map"><a class="anchor" href="#_notice_status_transition_map"></a>Notice status transition map</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A TED-SWS pipeline implement a hybrid architecture based on ETL pipeline
with status transition map for a notice. The TED-SWS pipeline have many
steps and is not a linear pipeline, in this case using a notice status
transition map, for a complex pipeline with multiple steps and
ramifications like as TED-SWS pipeline, is a good architecture choice
for several reasons:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Visibility</strong>: A notice status transition map provides a clear and visual
representation of the different stages that a notice goes through in the
pipeline. This allows for better visibility into the pipeline, making it
easier to understand the flow of data and to identify any issues or
bottlenecks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Traceability</strong>: A notice status transition map allows for traceability
of notices in the pipeline, which means that it&#8217;s possible to track a
notice as it goes through the different stages of the pipeline. This can
be useful for troubleshooting, as it allows for the identification of
which stage the notice failed or had an issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Error Handling</strong>: A notice status transition map allows for the
definition of error handling procedures for each stage in the pipeline.
This can be useful for identifying and resolving errors that occur in
the pipeline, as it allows for a clear understanding of what went wrong
and what needs to be done to resolve the issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Auditing</strong>: A notice status transition map allows for the auditing of
notices in the pipeline, which means that it&#8217;s possible to track the
history of a notice, including when it was processed, by whom, and
whether it was successful or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monitoring</strong>: A notice status transition map allows for the monitoring
of notices in the pipeline, which means that it&#8217;s possible to track the
status of a notice, including how many notices are currently being
processed, how many have been processed successfully, and how many have
failed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automation</strong>: A notice status transition map can be used to automate
some of the process, by defining rules or triggers to move notices
between different stages of the pipeline, depending on the status of the
notice.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each notice has a status during the pipeline, a status corresponds to a
step in the pipeline that the notice passed. Figure 3.1 shows the
transition flow of the status of a notice, as a note we must take into
account that a notice can only be in one status at a given time.
Initially, each notice has the status of RAW and the last status, which
means finishing the pipeline, is the status of PUBLICLY_AVAILABLE.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Based on the use cases of this pipeline, the following statuses of a
notice are of interest to the end user:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>RAW</p>

<p>The INDEXED status means that the set of unique XPaths appearing in its
XML manifestation has been calculated for a notice. The unique set of
XPaths is subsequently required when calculating the XPath coverage
indicator for the transformation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The NORMALISED_METADATA status means that for a notice, its metadata has
been normalised. The metadata of a notice is normalised in an internal
format to be able to check the eligibility of a notice to be transformed
with a Mapping Suite package.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The status DISTILLED is used to indicate that the RDF manifestation of a
notice has been post processed. The post-processing of an RDF
manifestation provides for the deduplication of the Procedure or
Organization type entities and the insertion of corresponding triplets
within this RDF manifestation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The PUBLISHED status means that a notice has been sent to Cellar, which
does not mean that it is already available in Cellar. Since there is a
time interval between the transmission and the actual appearance in the
Cellar, it is necessary to check later whether a notice is available in
the Cellar or not. If the verification has taken place and the notice is
available in the Cellar, it is assigned the status of
PUBLICLY_AVAILABLE, if it is not available in the Cellar, the status of
PUBLICLY_UNAVAILABLE is assigned to it.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice structure has a NoSQL data model, this architecture choice is
based on dynamic behaviour of notice structure which evolves over time
while TED-SWS pipeline running and besides that there are other reasons:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Schema-less</strong>: NoSQL databases are schema-less, which means that the
data structure can change without having to modify the database schema.
This allows for more flexibility when processing data, as new data types
or fields can be easily added without having to make changes to the
database. This is particularly useful for notices that are likely to
evolve over time, as the structure of the notices can change without
having to make changes to the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Handling Unstructured Data</strong>: NoSQL databases are well suited for
handling unstructured data, such as JSON or XML, that can&#8217;t be handled
by SQL databases. This is particularly useful for ETL pipelines that
need to process unstructured data, as notices are often unstructured and
may evolve over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Handling Distributed Data</strong>: NoSQL databases are designed to handle
distributed data, which allows for data to be stored and processed on
multiple servers. This can help to improve performance and scalability,
as well as provide fault tolerance. This is particularly useful for
notices that are likely to evolve over time, as the volume of data may
increase and need to be distributed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexible Querying</strong>: NoSQL databases allow for flexible querying, which
means that the data can be queried in different ways, including by
specific fields, by specific values, and by ranges. This allows for more
flexibility when querying the data, as the structure of the notices may
evolve over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost-effective</strong>: NoSQL databases are generally less expensive than SQL
databases, as they don&#8217;t require expensive hardware or specialized
software. This can make them a more cost-effective option for ETL
pipelines that need to handle large amounts of data and that are likely
to evolve over time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Overall, a NoSQL data model is a good choice for notice structure in an
ETL pipeline that is likely to evolve over time because it allows for
more flexibility when processing data, handling unstructured data,
handling distributed data, flexible querying and it&#8217;s cost-effective.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Figure 3.2 shows the structure of a notice and its evolution depending
on the state in which a notice is located. In the given figure, the
emphasis is placed on the states from which a certain part of the
structure of a notice is present. As a remark, it should be taken into
account that once an element of the structure of a notice is present for
a certain state, it will also be present for all the states derived from
it, such as the flow of states presented in Figure 3.1.</p>
