<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although TED notice data is already available to the general public
through the search API provided by the TED website, the current offering
has many limitations that impede access to and reuse of the data. One
such important impediment is for example the current format of the data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Historical TED data come in various XML formats that evolved together
with the standard TED XML schema. The imminent introduction of eForms
will also introduce further diversity in the XML data formats available
through TED&#8217;s search API. This makes it practically impossible for users
to consume and process data that span across several years, as
their information systems must be able to process several different
flavours of the available XML schemas as well as to keep up with the
schema&#8217;s continuous evolution. Their search capabilities are therefore
confined to a very limited set of metadata.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The TED Semantic Web Service will remove these barriers by providing one
common format for accessing and reusing all TED data. Coupled with the
eProcurement Ontology, the TED data will also have semantics attached to
them allowing users to directly link them with other datasets.
Moreover, users will now be able to perform much more elaborate
queries directly on the data source (through the SPARQL endpoint). This
will reduce their need for data warehousing in order to perform complex
queries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These developments, by lowering the barriers, will give rise to a vast
number of new use-cases that will enable stakeholders and end-users to
benefit from increased availability of analytics. The ability to perform
complex queries on public procurement data will be equally open to large
information systems as well as to simple desktop users with a copy of
Excel and an internet connection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To summarize, the TED Semantic Web Service (TED SWS) is a pipeline
system that continuously converts the public procurement notices (in XML
format) available on the TED Website into RDF format, publishes them
into CELLAR and makes them available to the public through CELLAR’s
SPARQL endpoint.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main points of architecture for a system that will transform TED
notices from XML format to RDF format using an ETL architecture with
batch processing pipeline are:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Data collection</strong>: A web scraper or API would be used to collect the
daily notices from the TED website in XML format and store them in a
data warehouse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data cleansing</strong>: A data cleansing module would be used to clean and
validate the data, removing any invalid or duplicate entries</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data transformation</strong>: A data transformation module would be used to
convert the XML data into RDF format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data loading</strong>: The transformed RDF data would be loaded into a triple
store, such as Cellar, for further analysis or reporting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pipeline management</strong>: Airflow would be used to schedule and manage the
pipeline, ensuring that the pipeline is run on a daily basis to process
the latest batch of notices from the TED website. Airflow would also be
used to monitor the pipeline and provide real-time status updates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data access</strong>: A SPARQL endpoint or an API would be used to access the
RDF data stored in the triple store. This would allow external systems
to query the data and retrieve the information they need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security</strong>: The system would be protected by a firewall and would use
secure protocols (e.g. HTTPS) for data transfer. Access to the data
would be controlled by authentication and authorization mechanisms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong>: The architecture should be designed to handle large
amounts of data and easily scale horizontally by adding more resources
as the amount of data grows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexibility</strong>: The architecture should be flexible to handle changes in
the data structure without having to modify the database schema.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance</strong>: The architecture should be designed for high-performance
to handle high levels of read and write operations to process data in a
short period of time.</p>
</li>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Figure 1.1 shows the compact, general image of the TED-SWS system
architecture from the system&#8217;s business point of view. The system
represents a pipeline for processing notices from the TED Website and
publishing them to the CELLAR service.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the monitoring and management of internal processes, the system
offers two interfaces. An interface for data monitoring, in the diagram,
the given interface is represented by the name of “Data Monitoring
Interface”. Another interface is for the monitoring and management of
system processes; in the diagram, the given interface is represented by
the name “Workflow Management Interface”. Operations Manager will use
these two interfaces for system monitoring and management.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The element of the system that will process the notices is the TED-SWS
pipeline. The input data for this pipeline will be the notices in XML
format from the TED website. The result of this pipeline is a METS
package for each processed notice and its publication in CELLAR, from
where the end user will be able to access notices in RDF format.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Providing, in Figure 1.1, a compact view of the TED-SWS system
architecture at the business level is useful because it allows
stakeholders and decision-makers to quickly and easily understand how
the system works and how it supports the business goals and objectives.
A compact view of the architecture can help to communicate the key
components of the system and how they interact with each other, making
it easier to understand the system&#8217;s capabilities and limitations.
Additionally, a compact view of the architecture can help to identify
any areas where the system could be improved or where additional
capabilities are needed to support the business. By providing a clear
and concise overview of the system architecture, stakeholders can make
more informed decisions about how to use the system, how to improve it,
and how to align it with the business objectives.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Figure 1.1 also is provided, input and output dependencies for a
TED-SWS system architecture. This is useful because it helps to identify
the data sources and data destinations that the system relies on, as
well as the data that the system produces. This information can be used
to understand the data flows within the system, how the system is
connected to other systems, and how the system supports the business.
Input dependencies help to identify the data sources that the system
relies on, such as external systems, databases, or other data sources.
This information can be used to understand how the system is connected
to other systems and how it receives data. Output dependencies help to
identify the data destinations that the system produces, such as
external systems, databases, or other data destinations. This
information can be used to understand how the system is connected to
other systems and how it sends data. By providing input and output
dependencies for the TED-SWS system architecture, stakeholders can make
more informed decisions about how to use the system, how to improve it,
and how to align it with the business objectives.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>XML Indexing Service</strong> is a service that extracts all unique XPaths from

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Metadata Normalization Service</strong> is a service that normalises the

<p>The pipeline for processing a notice is the key element in the TED-SWS
system, the architecture of this pipeline from the business point of
view is represented in Figure 2. Unlike the previously presented
figures, in Figure 2 the pipeline is rendered in greater detail and are
presented relationships between pipeline steps and the artefacts that
produce or use them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Based on Figure 2, it can be noted that the pipeline is not a linear
one, within the pipeline there are control steps that check whether the
following steps should be executed for a notice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are 3 control steps in the pipeline, namely:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Check notice eligibility for transformation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check notice eligibility for packaging</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check notice availability in Cellar</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The “Check notice eligibility for transformation” step represents the
control of a notice if it can be transformed with a Mapping Suite, if it
can be transformed it goes to the next transformation step, otherwise
the notice is stored for future processing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The “Check notice eligibility for packaging” step checks if a notice RDF
manifestation after the validation step is valid for packaging in a METS
package. If it is valid, proceed to the packing step, otherwise, store
the intermediate result for further analysis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The “Check notice availability in Cellar” step checks, after the
publication step in Cellar, if a published notice is already accessible
in Cellar. If the notice is accessible, then the pipeline is finished,
otherwise the published notice is stored for further analysis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pipeline steps produce and use artefacts such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>TED-XML notice &amp; metadata;</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Based on Figure 2, we can notice that the artefacts for a notice appear
with the passage of certain steps in the pipeline. To be able to
conveniently manage the state of a notice and all its artefacts
depending on its state, a notice represents an aggregate of artefacts
and a state, which changes dynamically during the pipeline.</p>

<h3 id="_notice_status_transition_map"><a class="anchor" href="#_notice_status_transition_map"></a>Notice status transition map</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A TED-SWS pipeline implement a hybrid architecture based on ETL pipeline
with status transition map for a notice. The TED-SWS pipeline have many
steps and is not a linear pipeline, in this case using a notice status
transition map, for a complex pipeline with multiple steps and
ramifications like as TED-SWS pipeline, is a good architecture choice
for several reasons:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Visibility</strong>: A notice status transition map provides a clear and visual
representation of the different stages that a notice goes through in the
pipeline. This allows for better visibility into the pipeline, making it
easier to understand the flow of data and to identify any issues or
bottlenecks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Traceability</strong>: A notice status transition map allows for traceability
of notices in the pipeline, which means that it&#8217;s possible to track a
notice as it goes through the different stages of the pipeline. This can
be useful for troubleshooting, as it allows for the identification of
which stage the notice failed or had an issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Error Handling</strong>: A notice status transition map allows for the
definition of error handling procedures for each stage in the pipeline.
This can be useful for identifying and resolving errors that occur in
the pipeline, as it allows for a clear understanding of what went wrong
and what needs to be done to resolve the issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Auditing</strong>: A notice status transition map allows for the auditing of
notices in the pipeline, which means that it&#8217;s possible to track the
history of a notice, including when it was processed, by whom, and
whether it was successful or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monitoring</strong>: A notice status transition map allows for the monitoring
of notices in the pipeline, which means that it&#8217;s possible to track the
status of a notice, including how many notices are currently being
processed, how many have been processed successfully, and how many have
failed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automation</strong>: A notice status transition map can be used to automate
some of the process, by defining rules or triggers to move notices
between different stages of the pipeline, depending on the status of the
notice.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each notice has a status during the pipeline, a status corresponds to a
step in the pipeline that the notice passed. Figure 3.1 shows the
transition flow of the status of a notice, as a note we must take into
account that a notice can only be in one status at a given time.
Initially, each notice has the status of RAW and the last status, which
means finishing the pipeline, is the status of PUBLICLY_AVAILABLE.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Based on the use cases of this pipeline, the following statuses of a

<p>The names of the statuses are self-descriptive, but attention should be
drawn to some statuses, namely:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>INDEXED</p>

<li>
<p>NORMALISED_METADATA</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>PUBLICLY_AVAILABLE</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The INDEXED status means that the set of unique XPaths appearing in its
XML manifestation has been calculated for a notice. The unique set of
XPaths is subsequently required when calculating the XPath coverage
indicator for the transformation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The NORMALISED_METADATA status means that for a notice, its metadata has
been normalised. The metadata of a notice is normalised in an internal
format to be able to check the eligibility of a notice to be transformed
with a Mapping Suite package.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The status DISTILLED is used to indicate that the RDF manifestation of a
notice has been post processed. The post-processing of an RDF
manifestation provides for the deduplication of the Procedure or
Organization type entities and the insertion of corresponding triplets
within this RDF manifestation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The PUBLISHED status means that a notice has been sent to Cellar, which
does not mean that it is already available in Cellar. Since there is a
time interval between the transmission and the actual appearance in the
Cellar, it is necessary to check later whether a notice is available in
the Cellar or not. If the verification has taken place and the notice is
available in the Cellar, it is assigned the status of
PUBLICLY_AVAILABLE, if it is not available in the Cellar, the status of
PUBLICLY_UNAVAILABLE is assigned to it.</p>

<h3 id="_notice_structure"><a class="anchor" href="#_notice_structure"></a>Notice structure</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice structure has a NoSQL data model, this architecture choice is
based on dynamic behaviour of notice structure which evolves over time
while TED-SWS pipeline running and besides that there are other reasons:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Schema-less</strong>: NoSQL databases are schema-less, which means that the
data structure can change without having to modify the database schema.
This allows for more flexibility when processing data, as new data types
or fields can be easily added without having to make changes to the
database. This is particularly useful for notices that are likely to
evolve over time, as the structure of the notices can change without
having to make changes to the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Handling Unstructured Data</strong>: NoSQL databases are well suited for
handling unstructured data, such as JSON or XML, that can&#8217;t be handled
by SQL databases. This is particularly useful for ETL pipelines that
need to process unstructured data, as notices are often unstructured and
may evolve over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Handling Distributed Data</strong>: NoSQL databases are designed to handle
distributed data, which allows for data to be stored and processed on
multiple servers. This can help to improve performance and scalability,
as well as provide fault tolerance. This is particularly useful for
notices that are likely to evolve over time, as the volume of data may
increase and need to be distributed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexible Querying</strong>: NoSQL databases allow for flexible querying, which
means that the data can be queried in different ways, including by
specific fields, by specific values, and by ranges. This allows for more
flexibility when querying the data, as the structure of the notices may
evolve over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost-effective</strong>: NoSQL databases are generally less expensive than SQL
databases, as they don&#8217;t require expensive hardware or specialized
software. This can make them a more cost-effective option for ETL
pipelines that need to handle large amounts of data and that are likely
to evolve over time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Overall, a NoSQL data model is a good choice for notice structure in an
ETL pipeline that is likely to evolve over time because it allows for
more flexibility when processing data, handling unstructured data,
handling distributed data, flexible querying and it&#8217;s cost-effective.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Figure 3.2 shows the structure of a notice and its evolution depending
on the state in which a notice is located. In the given figure, the
emphasis is placed on the states from which a certain part of the
structure of a notice is present. As a remark, it should be taken into
account that once an element of the structure of a notice is present for
a certain state, it will also be present for all the states derived from
it, such as the flow of states presented in Figure 3.1.</p>

<p>ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) architecture is considered
state-of-the-art for batch processing tasks using Airflow as pipeline
management for several reasons:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Flexibility</strong>: ETL architecture allows for flexibility in the data
pipeline as it separates the data extraction, transformation, and
loading processes. This allows for easy modification and maintenance of
each individual step without affecting the entire pipeline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong>: ETL architecture allows for the easy scaling of data
processing tasks, as new data sources can be added or removed without
impacting the entire pipeline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Error Handling</strong>: ETL architecture allows for easy error handling as
each step of the pipeline can be monitored and errors can be isolated to
a specific step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reusability:</strong> ETL architecture allows for the reuse of existing data
pipelines, as new data sources can be added without modifying existing
pipelines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>System management</strong>: Airflow is an open-source workflow management
system that allows for easy scheduling, monitoring, and management of
data pipelines. It integrates seamlessly with ETL architecture and
allows for easy management of complex data pipelines.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are several reasons why a monolithic architecture may be more
suitable for an ETL architecture with batch processing pipeline using
Airflow as the pipeline management tool:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Simplicity</strong>: A monolithic architecture is simpler to design and
implement as it involves a single codebase and a single deployment
process. This makes it easier to manage and maintain the ETL pipeline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance</strong>: A monolithic architecture may be more performant than a
microservices architecture as it allows for more efficient communication
between the different components of the pipeline. This is particularly
important for batch processing pipelines, where speed and efficiency are
crucial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong>: Monolithic architectures can be scaled horizontally by
adding more resources to the system, such as more servers or more
processing power. This allows for the system to handle larger amounts of
data and handle more complex processing tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Airflow Integration</strong>: Airflow is designed to work with monolithic
architectures, and it can be more difficult to integrate with a
microservices architecture. Airflow&#8217;s DAGs and tasks are designed to
work with a single codebase, and it may be more challenging to manage
different services and pipelines across multiple microservices.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) architecture is typically used for moving
and transforming data from one system to another, for example, from a
transactional database to a data warehouse for reporting and analysis.
It is a batch-oriented process that is typically scheduled to run at
specific intervals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Event sourcing architecture, on the other hand, is a way of storing and
managing the state of an application by keeping track of all the changes
to the state as a sequence of events. This allows for better auditing
and traceability of the state of the application over time, as well as
the ability to replay past events to reconstruct the current state.
Event sourcing is often used in systems that require high performance,
scalability, and fault tolerance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In summary, ETL architecture is mainly used for data integration and
data warehousing, Event sourcing is mainly used for building highly
scalable and fault-tolerant systems that need to store and manage the
state of an application over time.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Batch processing architecture and Event Streams architecture are two
different approaches to processing data in code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Batch processing architecture is a traditional approach where data is
processed in batches. This means that data is collected over a period of
time and then processed all at once in a single operation. This approach
is typically used for tasks such as data analysis, data mining, and
reporting. It is best suited for tasks that can be done in a single pass
and do not require real-time processing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Event Streams architecture, on the other hand, is a more modern approach
where data is processed in real-time as it is generated. This means that
data is processed as soon as it is received, rather than waiting for a
batch to be collected. This approach is typically used for tasks such as
real-time monitoring, data analytics, and fraud detection. It is best
suited for tasks that require real-time processing and cannot be done in
a single pass.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In summary, Batch processing architecture is best suited for tasks that
can be done in a single pass and do not require real-time processing,
whereas Event Streams architecture is best suited for tasks that require
real-time processing and cannot be done in a single pass.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Due to the fact that the TED-SWS pipeline has an ETL architecture, the
data processing is done in batches, the batches of notices are formed
per day, all the notices of a day form a batch that will be processed.
Another method of creating a batch is grouping notices by status and
executing the pipeline depending on their status.</p>

<h3 id="_why_airflow"><a class="anchor" href="#_why_airflow"></a>Why Airflow?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Airflow is a great solution for ETL pipeline and batch processing
architecture because it provides several features that are well-suited
to these types of tasks. First, Airflow provides a powerful scheduler
that allows you to define and schedule ETL jobs to run at specific
intervals. This means that you can set up your pipeline to run on a
regular schedule, such as every day or every hour, without having to
manually trigger the jobs. Second, Airflow provides a web-based user
interface that makes it easy to monitor and manage your pipeline.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both aspects of Airflow are perfectly compatible with the needs of the
TED-SWS architecture and the use cases required for an Operations
Manager that will interact with the system. Airflow therefore covers the
needs of batch processing management and ETL pipeline management.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Airflow provide good coverage of use cases for an Operations Manager,
specialized for this use cases:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Monitoring pipeline performance</strong>: An operations manager can use Airflow
to monitor the performance of the ETL pipeline and identify any
bottlenecks or issues that may be impacting the pipeline&#8217;s performance.
They can then take steps to optimize the pipeline to improve its
performance and ensure that data is being processed in a timely and
efficient manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Managing pipeline schedule</strong>: The operations manager can use Airflow to
schedule the pipeline to run at specific times, such as during off-peak
hours or when resources are available. This can help to minimize the
impact of the pipeline on other systems and ensure that data is
processed in a timely manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Managing pipeline resources</strong>: The operations manager can use Airflow to
manage the resources used by the pipeline, such as CPU, memory, and
storage. They can also use Airflow to scale the pipeline up or down as
needed to meet changing resource requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Managing pipeline failures</strong>: Airflow allows the operations manager to
set up notifications and alerts for when a pipeline fails or a task
fails. This allows them to quickly identify and address any issues that
may be impacting the pipeline&#8217;s performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Managing pipeline dependencies</strong>: The operations manager can use Airflow
to manage the dependencies between different tasks in the pipeline, such
as ensuring that notice fetching is completed before notice indexing or
notice metadata normalization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Managing pipeline versioning</strong>: Airflow allows the operations manager to
maintain different versions of the pipeline, which can be useful for
testing new changes before rolling them out to production.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Managing pipeline security</strong>: Airflow allows the operations manager to
set up security controls to protect the pipeline and the data it
processes. They can also use Airflow to audit and monitor access to the
pipeline and the data it processes.</p>

<h3 id="_why_metabase"><a class="anchor" href="#_why_metabase"></a>Why Metabase?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Metabase is an excellent solution for data analysis and KPI monitoring
for a batch processing system, as it offers several key features that
make it well suited for this type of use case required within the
TED-SWS system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, Metabase is highly customizable, allowing users to create and
modify dashboards, reports, and visualizations to suit their specific
needs. This makes it easy to track and monitor the key performance
indicators (KPIs) that are most important for the batch processing
system, such as the number of jobs processed, the average processing
time, and the success rate of job runs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Second, Metabase offers a wide range of data connectors, allowing users
to easily connect to and query data sources such as SQL databases, NoSQL
databases, CSV files, and APIs. This makes it easy to access and analyze
the data that is relevant to the batch processing system. In TED-SWS the
data domain model is realized by a document-based data model, not a
tabular relational data model, so Metabase is a good tool for analyzing
data with a document-based model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Third, Metabase has a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to
navigate and interact with data, even for users with little or no
technical experience. This makes it accessible to a wide range of users,
including business analysts, data scientists, and other stakeholders who
need to monitor and analyse the performance of the batch processing
system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, Metabase offers robust security and collaboration features,
making it easy to share and collaborate on data and insights with team
members and stakeholders. This makes it an ideal solution for
organizations that need to monitor and analyse the performance of a
batch processing system across multiple teams or departments.</p>

<h3 id="_why_quick_deduplication_process"><a class="anchor" href="#_why_quick_deduplication_process"></a>Why quick deduplication process?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the main challenges in entities deduplication from the semantic
web domain is dealing with the complexity and diversity of the data.
This can include dealing with different data formats, schemas, and
vocabularies, as well as handling missing or incomplete data.
Additionally, entities may have multiple identities or representations,
making it difficult to determine which entities are duplicates and which
are distinct. Another difficulty is the scalability of the algorithm to
handle large amount of data. The performance of the algorithm should be
efficient and accurate to handle huge number of entities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are several approaches and solutions for entities deduplication in
the semantic web. Some of the top solutions include:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>String-based methods</strong>: These methods use string comparison techniques
such as Jaccard similarity, Levenshtein distance, and cosine similarity
to identify duplicates based on the similarity of their string
representations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Machine learning-based methods</strong>: These methods use machine learning
algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, and neural networks
to learn patterns in the data and identify duplicates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Knowledge-based methods</strong>: These methods use external knowledge sources
such as ontologies, taxonomies, and linked data to disambiguate entities
and identify duplicates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hybrid methods</strong>: These methods combine multiple techniques, such as
string-based and machine learning-based methods, to improve the accuracy
of deduplication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Blocking Method</strong>: This method is used to reduce the number of entities
that need to be compared by grouping similar entities together.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the TED-SWS pipeline, the deduplication of Organization type entities
is performed using a string-based methods. String-based methods are
often used for organization entity deduplication, because of their
simplicity and effectiveness.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TED Europe data often contains information about tenders and public
procurement, where organizations are identified by their names.
Organization names are often unique and can be used to identify
duplicates with high accuracy. String-based methods can be used to
compare the similarity of different organization names, which can be
effective in identifying duplicates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, the TED europe data is highly structured, so it&#8217;s easy to
extract and compare the names of organizations. String-based methods are
also relatively fast and easy to implement, making them a good choice
for large data sets. This methods may not be as effective for other
types of entities, such as individuals, where additional information may
be needed to identify duplicates. It&#8217;s also important to note that
string-based methods may not work as well for misspelled or abbreviated
names.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using a quick and dirty deduplication approach instead of a complex
system at the first iteration of a system implementation can be
beneficial for several reasons:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Speed</strong>: A quick approach can be implemented quickly and can
help to identify and remove duplicates quickly. This can be particularly
useful when working with large and complex data sets, where a more
complex approach may take a long time to implement and test.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: A quick and dirty approach is generally less expensive to
implement than a complex system, as it requires fewer resources and less
development time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simplicity</strong>: A quick and dirty approach is simpler and easier to
implement than a complex system, which can reduce the risk of errors and
bugs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexibility</strong>: A quick and dirty approach allows to start with a basic
system and adapt it as needed, which can be more flexible than a complex
system that is difficult to change.</p>

<p><strong>Testing</strong>: A quick and dirty approach allows to test the system quickly,
and get feedback from the users and stakeholders, and then use that
feedback to improve the system.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, it&#8217;s worth noting that the quick and dirty approach is not a
long-term solution and should be used only as a first step in the
implementation of a MDR system. This approach can help to quickly
identify and remove duplicates and establish a basic system, but it may
not be able to handle all the complexity and diversity of the data, so
it&#8217;s important to plan for and implement more advanced techniques as the
system matures.</p>

<h3 id="_what_are_the_plans_for_the_future_deduplication"><a class="anchor" href="#_what_are_the_plans_for_the_future_deduplication"></a>What are the plans for the future deduplication?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the future, another Master Data Registry type system will be used to
deduplicate entities in the TED-SWS system, which will be implemented
according to the requirements for deduplication of entities from
notices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The future Master Data Registry (MDR) system for entity deduplication
should have the following architecture:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Data Ingestion</strong>: This component is responsible for extracting and
collecting data from various sources, such as databases, files, and
APIs. The data is then transformed, cleaned, and consolidated into a
single format before it is loaded into the MDR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Quality</strong>: This component is responsible for enforcing data quality
rules, such as format, completeness, and consistency, on the data before
it is entered into the MDR. This can include tasks such as data
validation, data standardization, and data cleansing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Entity Dedup</strong>: This component is responsible for identifying and
removing duplicate entities in the MDR. This can be done using a
combination of techniques such as string-based, machine learning-based,
or knowledge-based methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Governance</strong>: This component is responsible for ensuring that the
data in the MDR is accurate, complete, and up-to-date. This can include
processes for data validation, data reconciliation, and data
maintenance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Access and Integration</strong>: This component provides access to the MDR
data through a user interface and API&#8217;s, and integrates the MDR data
with other systems and applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Security</strong>: This component is responsible for ensuring that the
data in the MDR is secure, and that only authorized users can access it.
This can include tasks such as authentication, access control, and
encryption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Management</strong>: This component is responsible for managing the data
in the MDR, including tasks such as data archiving, data backup, and
data recovery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monitoring and Analytics</strong>: This component is responsible for monitoring
and analysing the performance of the MDR system, and for providing
insights into the data to help improve the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Services layer</strong>: This component is responsible for providing services
such as, indexing, search and query functionalities over the data.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All these components should be integrated and work together to provide a
comprehensive and efficient MDR system for entity deduplication. The
system should be scalable and flexible enough to handle large amounts of
data and adapt to changing business requirements.</p>
